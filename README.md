24 Neopixel Ring
=======

Simple simulation of a 24 Neopixel ring using zeroeth's fauxels repo https://github.com/zeroeth/fauxels


This fork simulates exclusively a 24 neopixel ring by slightly modifying Fauxels library, which originally
provides more flexibility for the number of neopixels among other features.


Fauxels creatively uses a simplified version of Adafruit's Neopixel library for Arduino and sketch.ino to create
and control simulation. Please visit https://github.com/zeroeth/fauxels for more details about this cool library.

This fork provides an out of the box sketch.ino to simulate a cool led effect on the ring.

To use clone or download and compile using make, a directory named dist with an executable inside is created.
By executing this file, the simulation will begin opening a new window and rendering the ring.

Fauxels uses  libsdl2-gfx-dev
